# hello-world
a place to store files as I develop a site for cemmercial reasons aligned to the Philippines' Govt. DICT Project. I wish to  create a simple, cost effective means of integreating the various elements of 365 so that the many thousands of SME's along Manila's heavily congested city centre thorough-fare, can realistically and demonstrably show a shift in working patterns towards a signficant amount of working from home. 
The service should be highly branded, involve simple appications development to integrate by database and workflows, marketing, Sales, Extimating, Operations, Admin and Finance Departments of any generic SME upto say 50 employees.
A big ask, but I have been thinking about it for some time,a dn the governement has jsut started to indtroduce free broadband for the 24km stretch of road (EDSA), that I am targetting, together with other financial incentives to become involved. This is just a part of the governments ambitious National Broadband Plan with its ultimate target milestone being the realization of the Philippinesâ€™ long-term vision called AmBisyon Natin by 2040
